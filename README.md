# EasyWorship Export

This repo holds a utility that will export files from EasyWorship for easy import into ProPresenter!  
This repo will be a first project for many at our church and therefore, this readme will include a lot of first time install instructions.

## Instructions

### Install Git
Git is used to interact with git repositories like GitHub (what we're using).

##### Windows:
Go here and download 
http://git-scm.com/download/win 

##### Mac:
Get `Homebrew`, because you want to be cool!  
In your terminal window, run the following.  
(I highly recommend you get `iterm2`: https://www.iterm2.com/)

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)‚Äù`


Go here to learn more about homebrew  
https://brew.sh/

Then in your terminal (use iterm2), run the following:  
`brew install git`


### Install intelliJ
IntelliJ will be the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or in other words, the place where we write code:  
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download
  
    
    
If you have any issues with any of the above, contact an admin
